# OCI E2.1.Micro Capacity Solutions

This document collects approaches for dealing with "Out of host capacity" when trying to provision OCI E2.1.Micro instances.

## Immediate Solutions

### 1. Manual Rotation Through ADs
In Terraform Cloud, try each availability domain:
```
availability_domain_number = 0  # Try AD-1
availability_domain_number = 1  # Try AD-2  
availability_domain_number = 2  # Try AD-3
```

### 2. Best Times to Try
Based on community reports, best success rates:
- **Early morning** (2-7 AM local time)
- **Late night** (11 PM - 2 AM local time)
- **Weekends** generally better than weekdays
- **Avoid** business hours (9 AM - 6 PM)

### 3. Local Retry Script
Run the included script to automatically retry:
```bash
chmod +x capacity_retry.sh
./capacity_retry.sh
```

This will:
- Retry every 5 minutes
- Automatically rotate through ADs
- Stop when successful

### 4. Terraform Cloud Scheduled Runs
In Terraform Cloud workspace settings:
1. Go to Settings â†’ Run Triggers
2. Add Schedule
3. Set to run every hour during off-peak times
4. It will eventually succeed when capacity is available

## Tips from the Community

1. **Don't give up**: Users report success after 20-50 attempts
2. **Region matters**: Mumbai and Sydney often have better availability
3. **Persistence wins**: Set up automation and let it run
4. **Monitor OCI Status**: Check https://ocistatus.oraclecloud.com/
5. **Try after maintenance**: Capacity often available after OCI maintenance windows

## Alternative Approaches

### If you absolutely can't get E2.1.Micro:
1. **Use spot/preemptible instances** in other clouds during initial setup
2. **Develop locally** with Vagrant/VirtualBox mimicking OCI
3. **Request quota increase** (sometimes OCI support helps)
4. **Consider paid tier temporarily** (can be ~$30/month)

## Patience is Key
The free tier is popular. With automation and patience, you WILL get an instance. Most users report success within 24-48 hours of automated retrying.
